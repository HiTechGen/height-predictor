        <br><p>How do i calculate my future height?</p>
        <br><p>To calculate your future height you need to get your parents height in centimeters then the formula provided below will guide you.</p>
        <br><p>[ For Gene try 40 ≥ 60, For Environmental Factors try 1 ≥ 20 ]</p>
        <br><p>Formula for boy:</p>
        <p>(Father)+(Mother)=(Total)</p>
        <p>(Total)+(Gene)=(Total)</p>
        <p>(Total)÷2=(Total)</p>
        <p>(Total)+(Environmental Factors)=(Maximum Height)</p>
        <p>(Maximum Height)-(Age)=[Your Future Height]</p>
        <br><p>Formula for girl:</p>
        <p>(Father)+(Mother)=(Total)</p>
        <p>(Total)+(Gene)=(Total)</p>
        <p>(Total)÷2=(Total)</p>
        <p>(Total)-(Environmental Factors)=(Maximum Height)</p>
        <p>(Maximum Height)-(Age)=[Your Future Height]</p>
        <br><p>• First of all height is determined by 'Genetic' (from 40% to 60% of your height is gene), if your parents are short you'll be shorter or if your parents is tall you'll be taller.</p>
        <p>• Second is 'Environmental Factors' (from 1% to 20% of extra height is coming from it), so if you're unhealthy you're unlikely to reach your desired height.</p>
        <br><p>But don't lose hope yet!, There's still a chance for you to grow tall, if you're still in the stage of puberty you still have more time to exercise and grow a few inches taller, To get started your day one exercise try this basic exercise every morning.</p>

        <p>If you notice some improvements then that means it's actually working for you, but take note, you should always maintain your balance diet and avoid growth stunting factors.</p>
